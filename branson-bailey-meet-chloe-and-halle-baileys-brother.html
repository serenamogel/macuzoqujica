His sisters rose to fame as a musical duo, Chloe x Halle. They performed song covers on their YouTube channel. However, their lives changed after they did a cover of Beyoncé’s song “Pretty Hurts.” Almost ten years later, they have a record deal with Parkwood Entertainment.</p><p>In addition, they released two studio albums, received Grammy nominations, and secured leading movie roles. However, the former musical duo has decided to go solo, with the sisters releasing their music and albums. Due to his sisters’ fame, Branson started to gain public attention, as he had been by their side for the whole journey.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about the celebrity sibling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-23_05-18-16-fotor-2023082352047.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Branson_Bailey></span>How Old Is Branson Bailey?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chloe and Halle’s brother, Branson Bailey, was born in Mableton, Georgia, United States, on October 3, 2005. Hence, he is seventeen years old. He is an American national of African-American ethnicity, living with his family in Los Angeles, California, United States. However, he grew up in Mableton with his parents, Courtney and Doug Bailey.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, he is the couple’s only son and the only brother of the famous sisters. While details about his elementary education remain undisclosed, online reports suggest Branson is currently in high school. Despite his sister’s fame, the celebrity sibling shies away from social media and appears alongside his famous sisters at events.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Chloe_and_Halles_Brother_Into_Entertainment></span>Is Chloe and Halle’s Brother Into Entertainment?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, he isn’t. However, according to his sisters, Branson Bailey sometimes joins in on their musical sessions to record music. Aside from this, he enjoys basketball and track. Consequently, his now-deleted Instagram account had a highlight dedicated to basketball. In a now-deleted post, the celebrity sibling posted a video of him attempting a layup.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, he also shared videos of him practicing with his friends during their early morning sessions. Aside from his passion for basketball, Branson also enjoys track activities. Consequently, he trained at IMG Academy, posted several training videos on his highlights, and documented a session working on his hip mobility.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-23_05-18-23-fotor-2023082351957.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Siblings_Does_Branson_Bailey_Have></span>How Many Siblings Does Branson Bailey Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although most people think Branson has two siblings, he grew up with three siblings: Halle, Chloe, and Ski.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ski_Bailey></span>Ski Bailey<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Ski Bailey is Branson Bailey’s eldest sister. She was born on April 20, 1991. Unlike her sisters, Ski is not into music and acting. However, she is a digital content creator interested in beauty, fashion, and lifestyle. Since she is one of Chloe and Halle’s siblings, it’s no surprise that she has a considerably large following on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chloe_Bailey></span>Chloe Bailey<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>She was born Chloe Elizabeth Bailey on July 1, 1998, and is the second eldest of Branson Bailey’s siblings. She teamed up with her junior sister Halle to form their now-defunct musical duo, which Beyoncé mentored. In 2021, Chloe released her debut solo single, “Have Mercy,” which was certified platinum in the U.S. She released her debut studio album, “In Pieces,” in March 2023, to positive reviews from critics.</p><p>Aside from music, <a href=#>Chloe Bailey</a> appeared as Jazlyn Forster on the TV series “Grown-ish,” after having sung the theme song “Grown.” In addition, the talented singer has also appeared in several other productions, including “Meet the Browns,” “Swarm,” “Praise This,” and “Jane.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-23_05-18-03-fotor-2023082352130.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Halle_Bailey></span>Halle Bailey<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Born Halle Lynn Bailey on March 27, 2000, Halle is Branson’s third eldest sister. She is an American singer and actress who made a name in the entertainment industry as one-half of the music duo Chloe x Halle. She is an accomplished singer with five Grammy Award nominations with her sister. Halle released her debut solo single, “Angel,” in 2023.</p><p>Like Chloe, Halle is also a thriving actress with a few acting credits. As an actress, she played Sky Forster in the television sitcom “Grown-ish” (2018-2022). In 2023, Halle landed her first lead role as Ariel in Disney’s musical fantasy film “The Little Mermaid.” The talented singer has also appeared in several minor roles in other projects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/photo_2023-08-23_05-17-37-fotor-2023082352225.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Branson_Bailey_Share_a_Close_Bond_With_His_Sisters></span>Does Branson Bailey Share a Close Bond With His Sisters?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Away from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood and stardom, Branson Bailey shares a close bond with his sisters. They spend much time together, and he has made red carpet appearances with his famous sisters, Chloe and Halle. According to Chloe, her favorite moments include watching Halle drag Branson into joining their skincare rituals and facials.</p><p>Although he is the youngest of his siblings, Chloe and Halle often have deep conversations with Branson. While preparing him for the real world, his sisters uplift him at every chance; they remind him that he is perfect and has beautiful skin. In addition, they also advise him not to let people’s opinions of him determine how he views himself.&nbsp;</p><p>While Branson Bailey has yet to decide on a career path, he has gained the attention of his famous sister’s fans. Hence, many are eager to see what the future holds for the Bailey sisters’ brother.</p><p>Like Branson Bailey, Nicki Minaj’s brother, <a href=#>Micaiah Maraj</a>, also lives a low-profile life away from the media.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kr7Otzaymp2WSlratsdhmpJ6dpGKwqbjOnmSappRitaK4y55km5mZobK6v4ybqaismJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbranson-bailey-meet-chloe-and-halle-baileys-brother.html&text=Branson%20Bailey%3a%20Meet%20Chloe%20and%20Halle%20Bailey%27s%20Brother&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbranson-bailey-meet-chloe-and-halle-baileys-brother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbranson-bailey-meet-chloe-and-halle-baileys-brother.html&title=Branson%20Bailey%3a%20Meet%20Chloe%20and%20Halle%20Bailey%27s%20Brother" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbranson-bailey-meet-chloe-and-halle-baileys-brother.html&title=Branson%20Bailey%3a%20Meet%20Chloe%20and%20Halle%20Bailey%27s%20Brother" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbranson-bailey-meet-chloe-and-halle-baileys-brother.html&title=Branson%20Bailey%3a%20Meet%20Chloe%20and%20Halle%20Bailey%27s%20Brother" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbranson-bailey-meet-chloe-and-halle-baileys-brother.html&description=Branson%20Bailey%3a%20Meet%20Chloe%20and%20Halle%20Bailey%27s%20Brother" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michael-colyar.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Colyar">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./marie-dee.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marie Dee">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
