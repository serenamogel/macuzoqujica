Started as a garage band in 1961, the group’s blended harmonies, sophisticated arrangements and innovative recording techniques would propel their music to the top of the charts and provide impetus to the growing youth culture quickly embracing the look and sounds of Southern California surf life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With father Murry as manager and Wilson — <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://medium.com/cuepoint/getting-hit-in-the-head-with-a-lead-pipe-made-brian-wilson-a-better-musician-99a414f3fb6 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="almost completely deaf in his right ear" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">almost completely deaf in his right ear</a> following a physical head trauma as a child — in the role of songwriter, producer and frontman, the Beach Boys first album, Surfin’ Safari (1962), introduced the band’s early sound.

Monitoring the singer-songwriter 24 hours a day along with a team of assistants, Landy would help Wilson gain some control over his physical and mental health, but would also be <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/brian-wilsons-better-days-47475/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="accused of exploiting his control" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">accused of exploiting his control</a> over his patient during the almost 15 on-again, off-again years Wilson was in his care. Landy became so involved in every aspect of Wilson’s life he would be listed as a collaborator on the singer’s 1988 solo album, had Wilson’s memoir dedicated to him and was named a beneficiary in his will.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1991 Wilson’s family sued Landy, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjxeqq/vulnerable-celebrities-and-the-managers-who-tried-to-destroy-them data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="obtaining a restraining order" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">obtaining a restraining order</a> against the doctor.

Wilson credited Landy with helping his recovery through medication and forced abstinence, resulting in his return to performing and producing new music. Their relationship was the subject of the 2014 biopic Love & Mercy, starring John Cusack as Wilson and Paul Giamatti as Landy.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Wilson continues to struggle but has also 'been able to live a wonderful, healthy and productive life'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wilson’s friends credit his ongoing wellbeing to his second wife, Melinda, whom he married in 1995 and has five adopted children with. “She got him to see the right doctors,” longtime Wilson friend Jeff Foskett said to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.brianwilson.com/news/2012/11/30/brian-featured-in-people-magazine data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">People</a> in 2012. “She’s provided a family environment for him. They actually do things together.” Though Wilson admits he continues to struggle and still occasionally sees a therapist: “On my good days I feel creative, I laugh a lot, I go to my piano and play… Some days I don’t feel creative and I don’t talk to anybody.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Stepping away from the music again is not a consideration, says Wilson. “Oh, man. No retiring,” he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/brian-wilson-talks-mental-illness-drugs-and-life-after-beach-boys-103541/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a> in 2016. “If I retired I wouldn’t know what to do with my time. … I’d rather get on the road and do concerts and take airplane flights.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though his creative and performing output continues to be strong, he is aware his mental health must always come first. Wilson postponed dates on his 2019 Pet Sounds and Greatest Hits Live Tour after back surgeries caused him to feel “mentally insecure,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/brian-wilson-tour-postponed-845180 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to a press statement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">according to a press statement</a>.
