The very first season of the show was considered controversial, however, due to its depiction of a teenaged Gandhi, and the hunger strikes in India that followed that first season led to a swift cancelation.</p><p data-characters=579 data-current-count=952 data-injectable=true>For most shows, that would have been the end. But Clone High boasted just enough of a cult following to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">earn it a revival</a>, which officially released its first season 20 years after its predecessor left the airwaves. Clone High returned to screens, new and improved, in 2023, in the first of two seasons ordered by Max. That first season — well, technically the second — was broadly popular among critics, earning it a stellar 100 percent Tomatometer score. Audiences are less fond of the revival, but to be fair, audiences weren’t fond of the original — not at first.</p><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>The original Clone High didn’t become popular until after it was canceled, so it may be fair to assume that the same will be true for the revival. Audiences may only enjoy this show in the aftermath, which leaves Clone High with a good few years to wait before it attains the popularity of its predecessor — that is, unless season 2 absolutely dazzles, and elevates the show in the eyes of viewers.</p><h2 id=h-clone-high-s-season-2-release-date-trailer-and-where-to-stream data-injectable=false>Clone High‘s season 2 release date, trailer, and where to stream</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>Few shows have the confusing history of Clone High, which — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">due to its cancelation</a> and revival — is simultaneously headed toward its second and third season, depending on how you look at it. The show’s impending season is the second of the revival, but the third overall, which leaves many people referring to it in clashing terms.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>For the purpose of this article, we will consider the upcoming season to be season 2, since it’s a direct follow-up to season 1 of the revival. Following the first season by just under a year, season 2 of Clone High is set to release, in its entirety, on Max on Feb. 1.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Clone High season 2 cast</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Clone-High-revival.jpg><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>Many of the cast members that helped make the original run of Clone High so popular returned for the revival, with only a few prominent characters getting fresh voices. Several additional characters were also added to the lineup, allowing several of Hollywood’s biggest stars to add their talent to the cast.</p><p data-characters=573 data-current-count=887 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Clone High season 2 cast</a> will see Will Forte return as Abe Lincoln and Vincent van Gogh, alongside Nicole Sullivan’s Joan of Arc, Mitra Jouhari’s Cleopatra, Christopher Miller’s JFK and Mr. Besley Butlertron, and Phil Lord’s Principal Scudworth. Joining the OG lineup are a slew of hugely talented stars, including Christa Miller, who plays Candide Sampson, Vicci Martinez, who brings the iconic Frida Kahlo&nbsp;to life, Ayo Edebiri, who lends her talent to Harriet Tubman, Kelvin Yu, who plays Confucius, and Neil Casey, who plays Topher Bus.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>Then there’s the supporting cast, which adds the talent of Donald Faison, Neil Flynn, Jack Black, Stephen Root, and Jana Schmieding as various characters, alongside Mandy Moore, John Stamos, David Tennant, and Ian Ziering, all of whom appear as themselves in the oddball animated series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ykuM6nnGagmZy1br%2FEmqqopl1nerOxy56YrJ1dma61sYycmKysXZa7pXnMqKmeZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fclone-high-season-2-release-date-cast-and-more.html&text=Clone%20High%20season%202%20release%20date%2c%20cast%2c%20and%20more&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fclone-high-season-2-release-date-cast-and-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fclone-high-season-2-release-date-cast-and-more.html&title=Clone%20High%20season%202%20release%20date%2c%20cast%2c%20and%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fclone-high-season-2-release-date-cast-and-more.html&title=Clone%20High%20season%202%20release%20date%2c%20cast%2c%20and%20more" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fclone-high-season-2-release-date-cast-and-more.html&title=Clone%20High%20season%202%20release%20date%2c%20cast%2c%20and%20more" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fclone-high-season-2-release-date-cast-and-more.html&description=Clone%20High%20season%202%20release%20date%2c%20cast%2c%20and%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./delphine-cascarino-biography-boyfriend-or-girlfriend-family-salary-net-worth-516578-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Delphine Cascarino Biography: Boyfriend or Girlfriend, Family, Salary &amp;amp; Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jeremy-jackson-net-worth-155350.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeremy Jackson Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
