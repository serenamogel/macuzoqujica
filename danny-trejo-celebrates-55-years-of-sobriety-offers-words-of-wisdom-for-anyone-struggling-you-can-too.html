I then got out of prison in 1969,” Trejo explained, sharing that he didn’t realize he’d ignored his underlying substance abuse issue before entering the program.</p><p>“I didn’t think turning me on to marijuana was abuse when I was 8. I thought it was sharing. It was a form of abuse. I didn’t know,” the actor shared. “So when you finally start realizing, ‘Wait a minute man, this is not right,’ that’s when the healing really begins.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Trejo in the 1996 action/horror film “From Dusk Till Dawn.” <span class=credit>X/officialDannyT</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Trejo as the bartender at Rocky’s bar, grill, and fine dining for the 2004 film “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.” <span class=credit>CBS via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Following his release in August 1969, the actor kept his promise to himself and God and stayed clean, ushering in over five decades of a flourishing acting career.</p><p>Since landing his first acting role in 1985’s “Runaway Train,” Trejo has 420 acting credits under his belt, according to the star’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb page</a>.</p><p>“I wake up every morning and say, ‘Dear heavenly Father, please let me help whoever I can for my fellow man. And I’ll say your name every day, and I’ll do whatever I can,’” Trejo shared.</p><p>His strong faith and guidance from God have not subsided in the years since his release, with the actor still keeping a dialogue with the higher power.</p><p>“He lived up to his deal. I’m living up to mine,” he told the outlet. “I even asked God a couple of days ago, ‘How am I doing?’ He said, ‘Trejo, you’re doing great. Keep it up. You’re almost out of hell.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Fma21fma6vuthmq6udmqR6pLHLnpmrmaSawG6BlGawnpmiqHqwsoysppuqmZrBunnOn52eqqNixLC%2Bw6xkqJ5drLa0sM6mZJ%2BnomKur8XOp5xmq6Snwqizy6KloGWppMJur8CnZK2nn2Q%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdanny-trejo-celebrates-55-years-of-sobriety-offers-words-of-wisdom-for-anyone-struggling-you-can-too.html&text=Danny%20Trejo%20celebrates%2055%20years%20of%20sobriety%2c%20offers%20words%20of%20wisdom%20for%20anyone%20%27struggling%2c%27%3a%20%27YOU%20C&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdanny-trejo-celebrates-55-years-of-sobriety-offers-words-of-wisdom-for-anyone-struggling-you-can-too.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdanny-trejo-celebrates-55-years-of-sobriety-offers-words-of-wisdom-for-anyone-struggling-you-can-too.html&title=Danny%20Trejo%20celebrates%2055%20years%20of%20sobriety%2c%20offers%20words%20of%20wisdom%20for%20anyone%20%27struggling%2c%27%3a%20%27YOU%20C" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdanny-trejo-celebrates-55-years-of-sobriety-offers-words-of-wisdom-for-anyone-struggling-you-can-too.html&title=Danny%20Trejo%20celebrates%2055%20years%20of%20sobriety%2c%20offers%20words%20of%20wisdom%20for%20anyone%20%27struggling%2c%27%3a%20%27YOU%20C" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdanny-trejo-celebrates-55-years-of-sobriety-offers-words-of-wisdom-for-anyone-struggling-you-can-too.html&title=Danny%20Trejo%20celebrates%2055%20years%20of%20sobriety%2c%20offers%20words%20of%20wisdom%20for%20anyone%20%27struggling%2c%27%3a%20%27YOU%20C" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdanny-trejo-celebrates-55-years-of-sobriety-offers-words-of-wisdom-for-anyone-struggling-you-can-too.html&description=Danny%20Trejo%20celebrates%2055%20years%20of%20sobriety%2c%20offers%20words%20of%20wisdom%20for%20anyone%20%27struggling%2c%27%3a%20%27YOU%20C" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./war-inc-2008.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="War, Inc. movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2008)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./corie-ventura-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Corie Ventura Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
