While it’s been reported that the cause was a heart attack, the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-09-17-vw-652-story.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Los Angeles Times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Los Angeles Times</a> also says it may have been from “complications brought on by alcohol and drug addiction.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Five days later, a baby girl was born in Montgomery, Alabama.

Eventually, she got in touch with an uncle and Williams' cousin, Marie Harvell.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She learned that her birth mother was a secretary in Nashville who became pregnant with Williams' baby just months before he married another woman, Billie Jean Eschliman. But her father was committed to make sure the unborn baby was taken care of — pledging to pay the medical bills and giving Jett a one-way ticket to California, with the promise that after two years, he would take custody of the child.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"My daddy loved me enough to do something just for me," <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/02034/jett-keynote.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she said in 2002" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">she said in 2002</a>.

And in 1985, the Alabama State Court <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://lancasteronline.com/features/entertainment/jett-williams-embraces-her-musical-and-personal-legacy/article_6eceaba3-e7f9-59fb-8a13-6c45c390c1cc.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="determined legally" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">determined legally</a> that she was indeed the singer’s daughter.
