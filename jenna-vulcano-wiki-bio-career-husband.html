The cringe comedy show is centered around the four members of The Tenderloins: Joseph “Joe” Gatto, James “Murr” Murray, Brian “Q” Quinn, and Salvatore “Sal” Vulcano. The series followed a simple premise, the jokers present competitive dares to each other and rank the other’s performances. The one with the most thumbs-up wins the game and the one with the most thumbs-down loses the game. While the premise was simple, it made for some hilarious moments. One of which has to do with Sal’s younger sister, Jenna Vulcano. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Jenna Vulcano.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life</h2><p>Jenna Vulcano was born on August 4, 1986, in Staten Island, New York, to Sal Vulcano Sr.&nbsp;and Dianne Fernandez-Vulcano.&nbsp;She has two siblings, Dana and Sal, who are both older than her.&nbsp;Jenna’s parents divorced when she was young, but she remained close to her father and often posts pictures of him on social media.&nbsp;Jenna after completing high school attended Kingsborough Community College, where she studied Public Relations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/website-2020-08-10T125654.020.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career:</h2><p>Like her early life, much of Jenna’s professional career has been kept in the dark. As her time in fame was short-lived, Jenna never disclosed any details about her work life. Over the years, Jenna has worked in a number of odd jobs including as a coordinator and a receptionist. She currently works as a medical receptionist in New York, Staten Island area.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Impractical Jokers</h2><p>Jenna made her debut on Impractical Jokers in 2012, in an episode titled “Strip High Five”. In this episode, she and Joe’s sister Carla had to give high-fives to strangers while wearing only their underwear. If they failed to get a high five, they had to remove an article of clothing.&nbsp;Jenna and Carla managed to get enough high fives to avoid getting fully naked, much to the relief of Sal and Joe.</p><p>Jenna’s second appearance on the show was in 2013, in an episode called “Down in the Dump”. In this episode, Joe and Sal had to present a slideshow about a vacation resort to a group of people. However, they did not know that the slides contained embarrassing photos of Jenna with Q and Murr. The photos showed Jenna kissing Q, standing with a naked Q, and in bed with Q and Murr.&nbsp;Sal was shocked and disgusted by the photos, while Joe tried to act casual.</p><p>Jenna’s third and most memorable appearance on the show was in 2014, in the season 3 finale called “Brother-in-Loss”. In this episode, Jenna legally married Murr in front of Sal, his family, and friends, as part of Sal’s punishment. Sal was blindfolded and taken to a chapel, where he had to witness his sister walking down the aisle in a white wedding dress and a veil towards Murr. The priest and the vows referred to Jenna as “Sal’s sister”, and Murr declared that he got a wife and a brother on the same day. Sal was speechless and furious by the prank, while Murr stated that it was revenge for his skydiving punishment.&nbsp;The marriage was annulled the same night.</p><p>Jenna Vulcano has not appeared on Impractical Jokers since then, but she remains close with her brother Sal and his friends.&nbsp;In addition to Impractical Jokers, Jenna has two more television credits. She appeared in one episode of The Misery Index in 2020 and one episode of Impractical Jokers: After Party in 2021.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Husband and Kids</h2><p>Jenna Vulcano is a woman of many talents. She is an actress, a comedian, a coordinator, and a receptionist. But perhaps the most intriguing aspect of her life is her marital history.</p><p>Jenna Vulcano married James Murray, another star of Impractical Jokers, in 2014. However, their union was not based on love, but on a prank. Murray planned the wedding as a way to get back at Sal, who had lost a challenge on the show. Sal was blindfolded and taken to the church, where he witnessed his sister and his friend exchange vows. He was shocked and speechless, while the audience laughed at his reaction.&nbsp;The wedding was annulled, and the whole episode was aired on TV.</p><p>Jenna Vulcano’s real husband is George C Shammas, whom she married in 2018.&nbsp;George is a native of Staten Island and works as an assistant service manager at Mazda.&nbsp;They live together with their two kids in Toms River, New Jersey.&nbsp;Jenna has not revealed much about her children.&nbsp;She has also been rumored to have a teenage daughter named Leah, but she has neither confirmed nor denied this speculation.</p><p>Jenna Vulcano seems to be happy and content with her family life. She often posts pictures of her husband, kids, parents, and siblings on her social media accounts. She also supports her brother’s career and occasionally appears on his show. Jenna Vulcano is a woman who knows how to balance humor and love in her life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Physical Traits</h2><p>Jenna Vulcano is a real head-turner. She has long, curly black hair that goes well with hazel green eyes and her tan skin. She has some cute freckles on her nose too. She is slim and tall, and she knows how to dress up. Jenna likes to wear cool and classy clothes, like suits, skirts, shirts and heels. She also wears some nice jewelry, like pearls, necklaces or watches. She always looks like a boss but is also friendly and fun.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personality Traits</h2><p>Jenna Vulcano is a Leo, born on&nbsp;August 4, 1986. Leos are known for being&nbsp;confident, ambitious, loyal, and generous. They are also&nbsp;creative, passionate, and charismatic, but can be&nbsp;stubborn, arrogant, and dramatic&nbsp;at times.</p><p>Jenna Vulcano is a person who enjoys humor and adventure. She is not afraid to take risks and have fun. She is also supportive of her brother’s career and loves her family dearly. She is a Leo who lives up to her zodiac sign’s traits.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Fact</th><th>Value</th></tr><tbody readability=13><tr><td>Full name</td><td>Jenna Vulcano</td></tr><tr><td>Date of birth</td><td>August 4, 1986</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place of birth</td><td>Staten Island, New York, USA</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Age</td><td>36 years old (as of June 2023)</td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac sign</td><td>Leo</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td>Sexuality</td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Hair color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Eye color</td><td>Hazel Green</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Dianne Fernandez Vulcano</td></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Sal Vulcano Sr.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Sal Vulcano (brother), Dana Vulcano (sister)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>The Kingsborough Community College</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, comedian, coordinator, receptionist</td></tr><tr><td>Net worth</td><td>$100,000 (estimated)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Debut TV show</td><td>Impractical Jokers (2012)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Number of episodes in Impractical Jokers</td><td>3 (“Strip High Five”, “Down in the Dump”, “Brother-in-Loss”)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Prank marriage partner</td><td>James Murray (one of the Impractical Jokers)</td></tr><tr><td>Real marriage partner</td><td>George C Shammas</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGihnqaelnq3wcucmKenXay2rLWMm6CoZZOWv6ax0WafrquSlrulew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjenna-vulcano-wiki-bio-career-husband.html&text=Jenna%20Vulcano%20%5bwiki%2fbio%20updates%5d%20married%20James%20Murray%20on%20television%20but%20who%20is%20her%20real%20husband%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjenna-vulcano-wiki-bio-career-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjenna-vulcano-wiki-bio-career-husband.html&title=Jenna%20Vulcano%20%5bwiki%2fbio%20updates%5d%20married%20James%20Murray%20on%20television%20but%20who%20is%20her%20real%20husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjenna-vulcano-wiki-bio-career-husband.html&title=Jenna%20Vulcano%20%5bwiki%2fbio%20updates%5d%20married%20James%20Murray%20on%20television%20but%20who%20is%20her%20real%20husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjenna-vulcano-wiki-bio-career-husband.html&title=Jenna%20Vulcano%20%5bwiki%2fbio%20updates%5d%20married%20James%20Murray%20on%20television%20but%20who%20is%20her%20real%20husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjenna-vulcano-wiki-bio-career-husband.html&description=Jenna%20Vulcano%20%5bwiki%2fbio%20updates%5d%20married%20James%20Murray%20on%20television%20but%20who%20is%20her%20real%20husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sakshi-tanwar.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sakshi Tanwar">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-fix-solve-palworld-no-work-suitability-with-cooling-what-to-do.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Fix / Solve Palworld No Work Suitability With Cooling  What to Do? - SarkariResult">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
