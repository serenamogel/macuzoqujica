Legend also appeared on the TV competition Duets as a coach before dropping his next album, 2013's Love in the Future. The artist shared an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Grammy with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/common data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Common class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Common</a> for their song "Glory," from the 2014 film Selma, and later received an Emmy for his performance in the 2018 production of Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Legend was born John Roger Stephens on December 28, 1978, in Springfield, Ohio. A child prodigy, Legend's grandmother taught him how to play the piano, and he grew up singing in the church choir. He went on to attend the University of Pennsylvania, where he directed a co-ed a cappella group. After graduation, he switched gears and worked for Boston Consulting Group, but continued to perform in nightclubs in New York City.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He was soon introduced to up-and-coming hip-hop artist Kanye West, and the two musicians collaborated on one another's demos.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Career Breakthrough: 'Get Lifted'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Legend's debut album, 2004's Get Lifted, went platinum thanks in part to the hit single "Ordinary People," a song he originally penned for the Black Eyed Peas. He went home with three Grammy Awards for Get Lifted: for best R&B album, best R&B male vocal performance and best new artist. Legend's sophomore effort, Once Again, was released in 2006.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Legend's musical talent has made him a mainstream star.

Evolver featured "Green Light," a collaboration with André 3000. This song proved to be a modest hit, and the album itself reached the top of the R&B/hip-hop charts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That same year, Legend stepped in front of the cameras with a supporting role in the comedy Soul Men, starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/bernie-mac data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bernie Mac" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bernie Mac</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/samuel-l-jackson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Samuel L.

The Curtis Mayfield-penned "Hard Times" was one of the record's main singles; another hit, "Shine," Legend's own composition, earned him a Grammy Award. He and The Roots also won a Grammy for best R&B album in 2011.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Legend tried his hand at reality television with the singing competition Duets during the summer of 2012.

In 2015, the songwriter, along with rapper Common, won a Golden Globe for Best Original Song—"Glory"—from the film Selma. The tune also won a Grammy and an Academy Award, with both artists using their Oscar acceptance speeches to highlight contemporary issues that connected to the Civil Rights Movement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On October 7, 2016, Legend debuted a new single, "Love Me Now."

We feel all those emotions. But It’s important for us to continue to show the world the fullness of what it is to be Black and human. Through our art, we are able to do that. This album is a celebration of love, joy, sensuality, hope and resilience, the things that make our culture so beautiful and influential.”</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life and Wife</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Outside of music, Legend is involved in numerous social and charitable causes.

I did well in high school and then went to an Ivy League school, but I was the exception. We need to do more to make sure every kid has a quality education."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Continuing with his commitment to education reform, Legend lent his song "Shine" to the 2010 documentary Waiting for Superman.
