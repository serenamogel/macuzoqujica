But the effects of his addictions still showed. “I went to work in extreme cases of hangovers.

He commuted between sets in Los Angeles and Dallas to play his parts. Around this time, he was drinking vodka by the quart.“I was sleepy and shaking at work,” he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/archive/cover-story-whole-new-man-vol-58-no-11/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But on February 23, 2001, something shifted. “I can’t describe it, because bigger things were taking place that I can’t put into words,” he said.

It was so public what was happening to me,” he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/matthew-perry-sobriety-service-two-815960 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “You can’t have a drug problem for 30 years and expect to solve it in 28 days.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2011, he went back into rehab as part of his continuing recovery. “I’m making plans to go away for a month to focus on my sobriety and to continue my life in recovery,” he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tmz.com/2011/05/12/matthew-perry-treatment-center-rehab-substance-abuse-friend-prescription-pills/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said in a statement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said in a statement</a>. But his trademark humor also came out: “Please enjoy making fun of me on the World Wide Web.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Not long after that, he decided to pay it forward by opening up the 5,500-square-foot Perry House in Malibu as a sober-living facility for men in 2013. While he sold his old home in 2015, he continued helping other people who were struggling with addiction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He even channeled his experiences into writing a stage play called The End of Longing, which debuted in London in 2016. “It’s personal, but it’s an exaggerated form of me. Jack, the character I play, is a much different drunk than I was,” he told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2017/legit/news/matthew-perry-friends-reunion-play-1202452798/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Variety</a>. “It flew out of me, this play.
