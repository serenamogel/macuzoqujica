Her shift to music that expressly demanded equality for Black Americans made her a hero to some—and an enemy to others. Despite this, Simone remained steadfast in her beliefs, leaving behind a lasting musical and social legacy.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Simone experienced the sting of racism at an early age</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nina Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon in February 1933, in Tryon, North Carolina, the sixth of eight children. Her mother was a Methodist minister and part-time domestic worker, and her father, himself an entertainer, supported his family working a number of jobs. Exposed to the music of her mother’s church while a toddler, Simone was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/raised-voice/amp?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=accompanying class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">accompanying</a> her mother’s sermons by the age of 3. At the age of 5, she began taking piano lessons—paid for by one of her mother’s white employers—with a local teacher who introduced her to classical music.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Simone would later <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA347968432&issn=15398706&it=r&linkaccess=abs&p=AONE&sid=googleScholar&sw=w&utm_source=pocket_mylist&v=2.1&userGroupName=nysl_oweb" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=write class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">write</a> in her autobiography that her family rarely discussed race at home and that she had grown up in a relatively integrated town. But she was not immune to the degradation and cruelty of the Jim Crow South. One incident occurred during a recital when she was 11. When her parents were forced to give up their front row seats to a white couple, Eunice stood her ground — refusing to play until her parents were returned to the front row. The pain of that moment was a revelation of sorts, and she later <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/raised-voice/amp?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=wrote class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">wrote</a> that she felt “as if I had been flayed, and every slight, real or imagined, cut me raw. But, the skin grew back a little tougher, a little less innocent, and a little more Black.”</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She shied away from politics early in her career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating from high school, Simone spent a summer at New York’s Juilliard School, preparing for her ultimate goal, admission to the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music. She was so certain of acceptance that her parents moved to Philadelphia to be closer to her dream conservatory. She was crushed when the program rejected her, and for the rest of her life <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/how-nina-simone-reinvented-herself-after-a-rejection-from-classical-music-conservatory/16781/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=believed class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">believed</a> that race had played a key role, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/how-nina-simone-reinvented-herself-after-a-rejection-from-classical-music-conservatory/16781/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=saying class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">saying</a> “I knew I was good enough, but they turned me down. And it took me about six months to realize it was because I was Black. I never really got over that jolt of racism at the time.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Desperate for work, she took a job as a pianist in Atlantic City, changing her name to Nina Simone so that her disapproving parents wouldn’t know she was working in nightclubs. An early employer would only hire her if she agreed to sing, as well as play piano, and she began a period of musical reinvention, combining her deep love of classical music with jazz, swing and popular music of the era. But as she began to build her career, she consciously avoided racism, sexism and other politically charged topics in her music. And she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/how-nina-simone-reinvented-herself-after-a-rejection-from-classical-music-conservatory/16781/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="seemed dismissive" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">seemed dismissive</a> of the folk and protest music that had become the soundtrack to the early civil rights movement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But if Simone avoided politics onstage, she was becoming increasingly political offstage. While living in New York City, she had befriended Black cultural leaders and writers like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/james-baldwin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="James Baldwin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">James Baldwin</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/langston-hughes data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Langston Hughes" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Langston Hughes</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/lorraine-hansberry data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lorraine Hansberry" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lorraine Hansberry</a>. Simone and Hansberry quickly formed a close bond, and the playwright, whose “A Raisin in the Sun” had explored the difficulties of Black life in 20th century America, became a teacher of sorts. As Simone <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/raised-voice/amp?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="later wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">later wrote</a>, “We never talked about men or clothes. It was always Marx, Lenin and revolution — real girls’ talk.”</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A deadly tragedy galvanized Simone into activism</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On Sunday, September 15, 1963, a bombing by white extremists at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, killed four young Black girls attending Sunday school. Simone, preparing for an upcoming series of club dates, was heartbroken — and incensed. She later admitted that her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/the-story-behind-nina-simones-protest-song-mississippi-goddam/16651/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="first instinct" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">first instinct</a> was violence. “At first I tried to make myself a gun. I gathered some materials. I was going to take one of them out, and I didn’t care who it was,” she later <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/the-story-behind-nina-simones-protest-song-mississippi-goddam/16651/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">said</a>. But at the urging of her then-husband, she fueled her anger and grief into music. In under an hour, she wrote one of her most famous songs, “Mississippi Goddamn,” whose title was inspired, in part, by the assassination of civil rights leader <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/medgar-evers data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Medgar Evers" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Medgar Evers</a> in the state earlier that summer.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The song’s upbeat tempo did little to temper the intensity of the song’s lyrics, which attacked the slow pace of racial justice in America, and the continued, centuries-long oppression of and violence against Black Americans. She would <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/the-story-behind-nina-simones-protest-song-mississippi-goddam/16651/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="revisit and revise" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">revisit and revise</a> the song’s lyrics in the coming years to incorporate later incidents of racial injustice in cities across the country.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Reaction to the song was mixed. Many of the primarily white audiences Simone initially performed in front of seemed uneasy or didn’t grasp the severity of the situation she described. Others, particularly in the South, had a much more <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/the-story-behind-nina-simones-protest-song-mississippi-goddam/16651/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="visceral reaction" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">visceral reaction</a>. There were protests, the song was<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/396923/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" banned" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> banned</a> in several states and there were numerous instances of people destroying copies of the record itself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Many African Americans applauded Simone for giving voice to their pain and anguish.

She <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/raised-voice/amp?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=met class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">met</a> Dr. King for the first time in 1965, after performing for marchers making their way from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama—many of whom had been brutally assaulted just a few days earlier during the infamous “Bloody Sunday.” Simone was vocal in her doubts about his more moderate approach, only to be reassured by an understanding King.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She was a supporter of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/malcolm-x data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Malcolm X" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Malcolm X</a>, and though she never met him, she would later become neighbors and friends with his wife, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/betty-shabazz data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Betty Shabazz" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Betty Shabazz</a>, while living in Mt. Vernon, New York. Her work was praised by other radical Black leaders, including <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/stokely-carmichael data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stokely Carmichael" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stokely Carmichael</a>, who had split with more moderate civil rights groups in favor of Black nationalism, giving rise to the “Black power” movement. Simone embraced a new personal style as well, wearing her previously straightened hair in a more natural Afro style and adopting a new Afrocentric wardrobe as well. Always self-conscious of the particular barriers faced by darker-skinned Black Americans like herself, she wrote songs challenging these notions, including 1966’s “Four Women,” which <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/raised-voice/amp?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=depicted class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">depicted</a> the effect of stereotyped “colorism” on Black women.

A violently turbulent marriage and increasing mental health issues (including then-undiagnosed bipolar disorder) took their toll as well. So did the 1965 death of Hansberry at the age of 34, and that of Dr. King, in 1968.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Though she had differed with him on tactics, she was deeply affected by his death. The following summer, she honored both Hansberry and King during her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/11/raised-voice/amp?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=performance class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">performance</a> at the Harlem Cultural Festival. She played a song in memory of King written by her bass player, and turned parts of an unfinished Hansberry play into a new song that would become a civil rights anthem, covered by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/aretha-franklin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Aretha Franklin" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Aretha Franklin</a> and others, “Young, Gifted and Black.” The performance also included a section where Simone, unwavering in her determination to improve the lives of Black Americans, exhorted the audience to use any means necessary—even violence—to achieve their goals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That same year, during an appearance on the PBS newsmagazine, Black Journal, Simone <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/the-story-behind-nina-simones-protest-song-mississippi-goddam/16651/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=noted class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">noted</a>, “An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times. That to me is my duty.
