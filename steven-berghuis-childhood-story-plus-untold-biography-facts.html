Thereafter, we will tell you about his England journey – in the quest for career success. Finally, that turning point in his career which brought him fame.</p><p>We hope to whet your autobiography appetite as you read Steven Berghuis’ Biography. To begin that, let’s first present you with this gallery of his boyhood years right to the moment of fame. Without a doubt, it tells a story that Steven has come a long way in his career life.</p><p>Yes, everyone knows this man is one of the midfield pillars of his country’s national team. Berghuis is a genius when it comes to making key passing, set-pieces, carrying the ball, long shots, and finishing. That makes him one of the world’s best attacking midfielders.</p><p>Although he has excellent stats for both club and country, we notice a knowledge gap. Not many Soccer fans have read an in-depth version of Steven Berghuis’ Biography. This is why we have prepared this Bio to satisfy your search intent. So, without further ado, let’s begin.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-berghuis-childhood-story></span>Steven Berghuis Childhood Story:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>For Biography starters, Steven Berghuis was born on the 19th day of December 1991 to his father, Frank Berghuis, and a little known Mother in Apeldoorn. Steven’s birthplace is both a municipality and a city in the province of Gelderland in the centre of the Netherlands.</p><p>The Dutch professional footballer is one among another sibling (a brother) who were born to the marital union between their Dad and Mum. Now, let’s introduce you to one of Steven Berghuis’ parents. Is there any difference between the footballer and his look-alike Dad?</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=growing-up></span>Growing-Up:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The town of Apeldoorn was where the footballer and his sibling (a brother named Tristan Berghuis) spent their childhood days. In fact, Steven Berghuis’ parents and most family members still live in this city. Tristan Berghuis, as mentioned earlier, is his younger brother.</p><p>Frank Berghuis genetically gifted Steven and his younger sibling the spirit of football. Both Tristan and Steven inherited their Dad’s soccer gene. As children, their dreams of following their Dad’s sporting footsteps weren’t seen as a passing fantasy. Young Stev dreamt more.</p><p>Drawing a Dutch flag on her son’s face was among the first bonds of emotional attachment Steven Berghuis’ Mum built with her son. The Youngster, a big fan of the Oranje Holland, could keep the painted flag on his face all day unless when he had to go to school.</p><p>Young Steven as a boy watched soccer, played it on local fields and dreamt of representing his country. But little did Berghuis know his country’s 2022 FIFA World Cup glory would rest heavily on his shoulders – about two decades from the day his Mum painted his face.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-berghuis-early-life></span>Steven Berghuis Early Life:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The talent of the young boy with a big dream (as people described him) was so difficult to ignore. Early on, his unique football qualities received instant support from his Dad who made sure he joined a team in the neighbourhood. Tristan, his brother, also joined similar teams (years later).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-berghuis-family-background></span>Steven Berghuis Family Background:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Starting off, his Dad who goes by the nickname Pico, operated a comfortable household.&nbsp; In other words, Steven Berghuis’ family wasn’t the super-rich type. Both of his parents raised him and his younger brother (Tristan) in a comfortable upper-middle-class family setting.</p><p>The Dutch winger did not get the most of his football qualities from a stranger. His Father Frank Berghuis genetically transferred the sporting virus to his two sons – Steven and Tristan. Pictured below, Pico (a left-winger) played mostly for clubs in the Netherlands.</p><p>Asides from PSV, Steven Berghuis’ Dad also made a name for himself with Galatasaray. The Turkish club and Lommel (a Belgium club) were the two foreign teams he played for. Watch this video to understand Frank Berghuis’ family better. What a positive influence he has on his sons.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-berghuis-family-origin></span>Steven Berghuis Family Origin:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>To start with, the footballer has Dutch nationality because he was born in the Netherlands and his parents are both from the European country. Apeldoorn, where Steven Berghuis’ family comes from, is a 1 hour 10 minutes drive away from Amsterdam (Dutch’s capital).</p><p>Located in the heart of the Netherlands, Steven’s hometown is one of the friendliest places to live in the country. Unfortunately, Apeldoorn has recently made headlines for the wrong reasons – following the 2009 attack on the Dutch royal family. We’ll discuss this later in the Bio.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-berghuis-ethnicity></span>Steven Berghuis Ethnicity:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A research conducted to determine the origins of his grandparents suggests the footballer is a Netherlander. Put simply, Steven Berghuis is part of the ‘Dutch people’ ethnic group. People connected to his ancestry comprise&nbsp;80% of the total population of the Netherlands.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-berghuis-education></span>Steven Berghuis&nbsp;Education:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the Netherlands, a compulsory Schooling Act applies to kids starting from the age of 5. For this reason, it is likely that he and his brother (Tristan) attended a Dutch school in his city. In fact, Steven Berghuis attended the Royal School Community (KSG) in Apeldoorn.</p><p><span>As the DPG Media Group report says, Steven got the best grades with two fingers in his nose. This adage means he was actually the best in his class and his good grades came with little effort. By implication, the Royal School Community had him as their best pupil.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-berghuis-biography-%e2%80%93-football-story></span>Steven Berghuis Biography – Football Story:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The youngster (pictured below) took his first steps as a soccer player in his hometown. At that time (in the late 1990s), his Dad, Frank, was in the twilight stages of his playing career. Steven Berghuis’ parents approved their son’s enrolment with Vitesse/AGOVV.</p><p>Like his father (Frank), young Steven started playing football as a left-footed winger. He was the best left-winger for his team through the early stages of his career. In the year 2002. Steven’s little brother, Tristan Berghuis (four years his junior), joined him at AGOVV Apeldoorn Youth.</p><p>Before calling himself a professional footballer, Steven Berghuis journeyed through other youth academy setups. Notably among them were WSV Apeldoorn (2007–2008), Go Ahead Eagles (2008–2009) and Twente (2009 – 2011). Twente was the last academy he attended.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-berghuis-bio-%e2%80%93-the-journey-to-fame></span>Steven Berghuis Bio – The Journey to Fame:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The son of Pico had a good start to life as a professional footballer. It happened shortly after he transferred to AZ in 2012. After scoring 20 goals for the club, Berghuis got lots of interest abroad. Watford, a then mid-table Premier League club, signed him in July 2015.</p><p>That 2015, Steven left his parents, family and country for the first long time. A Watford, he played alongside the likes of <span>Abdoulaye Doucoure</span>, <span>Odion Ighalo</span>, <span>Nathan Ake</span>, <span>Troy Deeney</span>, etc. Competition for first-team places saw him unable to secure a place in the Watford FC first team.</p><p>Sánchez Flores, the then coach of Watford, once expressed his frustrations with the Dutch. He wasn’t pleased with Berghuis’ performances, despite having high expectations of him. Before the 16–17 season, Watford’s first-team opportunities became further limited for Berghuis.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=going-back-to-his-country></span>Going back to his country:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Gelderland native, in 2016, accepted that playing in England doesn’t suit his style. With the intention to see through his contract, Berghuis pushed for a loan transfer back to his country. In 2016, Feyenoord accepted him, and Steven (while feeling nostalgic) happily posted this photo after he joined them.</p><p>In the words of Steven Berghuis;</p><h5 style=text-align:center><strong><span>This picture was taken years ago at a game between my amateur club WSV Apeldoorn and my current club Feyenoord Rotterdam.</span></strong></h5><h5 style=text-align:center><strong><span>I was 15 years old, and the day before, I heard I was part of the first team to play against a top team like Feyenoord.</span></strong></h5><h5 style=text-align:center><strong><span>We lost that match by 1-4, I played 15 minutes and scored the only goal. Upon scoring, I celebrated as if it was the Champions League final.</span></strong></h5><h5 style=text-align:center><strong><span>Funny to look back and realise I’m playing for Feyenoord now and being the captain of this club… Dream big for me.</span></strong></h5><p>Not only did Steven Berghuis become Feyenoord’s captain. He cemented his legendary status for the Dutch club. In fact, his career rejuvenation with Feyenoord proved Watford wrong. We’ll tell you about Steven’s achievement with this Dutch club in the next section of his life story.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-berghuis-bio-%e2%80%93-road-to-fame-story></span>Steven Berghuis Bio – Road to Fame Story:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Did you know?… He was part of Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s unknown Feyenoord side who conquered Ajax to win the 2016/2017 Eredivisie. Let’s not forget, <span>Tyrell Malacia</span> and <span>Robin van Persie</span> joined Steven Berghuis to help Feyenoord win the KNVB Cup the next season – (2017 – 2018).</p><p>Steven Berghuis’ success story didn’t end there. He (a true leader) led his Feyenoord side to win the Johan Cruyff Shield in 2017 and 2018. Because of Steven Berghuis’ continuous rise in Dutch football, a jealous Ajax muscled their way to steal him from Feyenoord.</p><p>In what we refer to as the <span>Most Controversial Transfer In Eredivisie History</span>, Ajax knew they had hurt Feyenoord fans. These fans went mad over the sale of their talisman and skipper. In fact, there were online videos of Feyenoord fans burning Steven Berghuis’ shirt and accusing him of betrayal.</p><p>The controversy of Berghuis’ transfer to a rival is like that of <span>Luis Enrique</span> (Real Madrid to Barca), <span>Carlos Tevez</span> (Man United to City), and <span>Emmanuel Adebayor</span> (Arsenal to City). The move caused controversy in the Netherlands because of the rivalry between the two clubs.</p><p>To prevent violence, away (Ajax and Feyenoord) fans were not allowed at matches between themselves. With Ajax, Berghuis went on to enjoy a formidable assist partnership with <span>Dusan Tadic</span> and <span>Ryan Gravenberch</span>.</p><p>He, alongside <span>Antony</span>, <span>Dusan Tadic</span> and <span>Jurrien Timber</span> became Ajax’s top performer in the 2021/2022 season. With the Dutch giants, Steve won these honours under <span>Erik ten Hag</span>‘s command.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=dutch-national-team-rise></span>Dutch National Team Rise:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Although few fans noticed, Berghuis has actually been a member of the Dutch national team since 2016. The footballer and his family were on holiday in New York when he first received an invitation from national coach Danny Blind (the father of <span>Daley Blind</span>).</p><p>At the time of writing Steven Berghuis’ Biography, he has risen so high to become one of the first names in <span>Louis van Gaal</span>‘s Dutch setup. The son Frank Berghuis hopes to have a blissful 2022 FIFA World and the best twilight career years. The rest, as we say, is history.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=steven-berghuis-girlfriend-%e2%80%93-nadine-bamberger></span>Steven Berghuis Girlfriend – Nadine Bamberger:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>To start with, she is the stunning long-term partner of the Dutch Baller.

This section of Steven Berghuis’ Bio tells you more about his parents and other family members. So, without further ado, let’s begin.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=about-steven-berghuis-father></span>About Steven Berghuis Father:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Frank ‘Pico’ Berghuis was born on the 2nd of May 1967 in Nunspeet, a Dutch town. He was 15 years old when he (very young and very early) left Apeldoorn to attend PSV boarding school. At that time, Football was all that mattered for Steven Berghuis’ Dad. And Paco saw his dream come true.</p><p>During Frank ‘Pico’ Berghuis’ playing career, he scored a total of 70 goals (Wikipedia report) for nine different clubs. In the course of his career, the Left-winger made one international appearance (in 1989) for the Netherlands national team.</p><p>Steven Berghuis’ Dad’s only international match was against Brazil. In that match, he was more concerned more with chasing after his opponent Jorginho. Although it was nice for Paco to have a national team experience, but it wasn’t a great success.</p><p>Did you know?… Frank ‘Pico’ Berghuis’ injury during his playing days ruined his career and played tricks on him. It was a lifestyle that stood in his way of breakthrough. Frank, in his early years, had plenty hair like <span>Gabriel Batistuta</span>. At some point, he partied a lot, and there were too many shows and playing discos.</p><p>Frank earned the nickname ‘Pico’ during his VVV playing days. He owes the name Pico to trainer Jan Reker. The trainer (back then) did not want a second Frank in addition to Frank Verbeek in his team. Because of that, he told Berghuis Dad… “<span><strong>I call you the name Pico</strong></span>,” And that was how he got the nickname.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=about-steven-berghuis-mother></span>About Steven Berghuis Mother:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The woman who gave birth to the Dutch and his brother, Tristan, has made efforts to avoid the public eyes.

The young brother of Steven Berghuis is five years younger. Tristan Berghuis followed in the footsteps of his Dad and older brother. PSV was the biggest club Steven’s brother ever played for.</p><p>Unlike his Dad and Big brother, Tristan Berghuis had a less satisfactory career. The Dutch footballer had his last playing career with SV Schalkhaar (an amateur football club from the Dutch village of Schalkhaar). Following that, Tristan Berghuis decided he would be a coach.</p><p>Steven Berghuis’ brother went on to acquire his UEFA A coaching licence. On the 1st day of July 2021, he got his first job, as a manager of Go Ahead Eagles U18 team. This is a Dutch professional football club from the city of Deventer.
