He tries to convince her that she has a magical connection to Snow White and Prince Charming, but it takes her a long time to finally connect the dots. Eventually, she realizes that the magical fairytale characters are actually her biological parents. There are so many interesting twists and turns to enjoy in Once Upon a Time.

He came from a long line of warriors who devoted themselves to justice, and members of his bloodline always dedicated themselves to defending the city they resided in from evil mythical creatures.

It includes many different mythical creatures, making it easily comparable to a show like Once Upon a Time. TVD stars Nina Dobrev, Ian Somerhalder, and Paul Wesley in the leading roles. They play characters stuck in a messy love triangle for a large portion of the series, but eventually, they are collectively able to decide which pairing is fate.

Instead of giving in to villainous impulses, they must learn how to control their urges to follow an ethical code. Since this show is a spin-off based around two successful series, fans had extremely high expectations for it — and the show creators never let anyone down.</p><p data-characters=63 data-current-count=63 data-injectable=false>Legacies can be streamed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CW</a> or rented on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime Video</a>.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Witches of East End (2013)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=539 data-current-count=902 data-injectable=true>Witches of East End is a fascinating supernatural drama that premiered in 2013.

The plot revolves around Chandler, a woman who was once saved by a mysterious man that disappeared thereafter. The “Beast” believes himself to be a menace to society; he harbors a dark secret about a strange medical condition that causes him to turn into a monster.

At first, McCall is unsure if he can still consider himself a human or if he will completely transition into a werewolf.
