Because it’s working.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>The 28-year-old comedian was on his way to the top when a series of controversies smashed his prospects into tiny little pieces. He still had a chance to recover, in the wake of that first ill-advised joke, but his response to the backlash — followed by his latest blunder — might just be enough to see Rife’s career end just as it was getting started.</p><p data-characters=574 data-current-count=937 data-injectable=true>It all <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">started with a single TikTok</a>, which took <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the once-obscure Rife</a> and rocketed him to newfound fame. Soon, he was securing movie deals, debuting in his very first Netflix comedy special, and seizing name recognition left and right. Then, the comedy special dropped, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and Rife’s decline began</a>. The star’s fanbase —&nbsp;made up almost entirely of women — was deeply displeased to discover that Rife chose to open the special with a joke about domestic violence. Backlash to the deeply outdated riff was swift, and Rife’s response was utterly lacking.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>His childish response — which urged upset fans to purchase helmets intended for those with special needs — only dug Rife in deeper, and his latest idiocy might finish the task for good. There’s only so much controversy any single star can endure, and Rife was barely a star to begin with.</p><h2 id=h-matt-rife-s-latest-beef-is-with-an-actual-child data-injectable=false>Matt Rife’s latest beef is with an actual child</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Matt_Rife_jupiter.jpg><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Matt Rife has already enjoyed several public beefs, including the one he started with his entire fanbase. That one should have been enough to scare the cock-sure 28-year-old straight, but just because Rife is pretty doesn’t mean he’s smart. He seems determined to shoot his freshly-born career right where it hurts, and his aim appears to be much better than his jokes.</p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>The latest career-ending move made by Rife <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">saw the fully-grown man-child</a> initiate a feud with an actual child. A six-year-old, to be exact.</p><p data-characters=675 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>It all started with Rife’s domestic violence joke, which ran off a huge chunk of his former fanbase. In response, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikToks poking fun</a> at the “comedian” started to take over, and TikTok creator @bunnyhedaya decided to get in on the fun. In response to a lackluster joke about Jupiter’s rings — “Just because Jupiter has a ring and you don’t…” — Hedaya jokingly allowed her son, who’s in his Space Era, to respond. That response was straightforward and charming, and simply saw the six-year-old inform Rife that “actually, its Saturn that has the rings, and it has more also. And you’re mean to girls.”</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>Rife could have responded in any number of ways. He could have poked fun at himself, something comedians do frequently, thanked the helpful little astronomer, or simply ignored the joke. Instead, he decided to respond, and made himself look like an even bigger ass than before.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true><a title=@bunnyhedaya href=#>@bunnyhedaya</a><p>Matt Rife started a fight with the wrong 6 year old. Buckle in. <a title=bunny href=#>#bunny</a> <a title=bunnyhedaya href=#>#bunnyhedaya</a> <a title=mommabear href=#>#mommabear</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - BUNNY 🐰" href=#>♬ original sound – BUNNY 🐰</a></figure><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>The response landed on Hedaya’s Instagram page, where Rife misspelled half of his attempted takedowns and worked to ruin Christmas for a child. He responded by saying “Jupiter also has ring [sic]. OH!… and Santa Clais [sic] isn’t real. Your mom buys you presents with the money she makes on OnlyFans. Good luck.”</p><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=832 data-injectable=true>Where to start. The inherent sexism? The childishness in responding in the first place? Or the absurdly adolescent decision to hone in on Christmas, which —&nbsp;more than anything — really drives home that you’re attempting to beef with a child. Each and every line in the absurd response reinforces how infantile Rife really is, and Hedaya’s follow-up only makes things worse. She’s measured and aghast in her video response to Rife, in stark contrast to his juvenile behavior.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>Since she’s officially responded to him on a public forum, Rife is all but certain to chime in yet again at some point. So, while this ridiculous saga is concluded for now, stay tuned. He’ll likely be back next week with some new offensive drivel to add to the list.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahsGaho2LBqrfTqKJmq6SWv265wK2rZqqZm7JursSenaKml2LEqsDHZphmq5mterqxwKtkqKSUYsGpsYyfnK6cXZrFsbjAoqWenF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-is-tiktok-star-matt-rife-beefing-with-a-six-year-old-the-feud-explained.html&text=Why%20is%20TikTok%20star%20Matt%20Rife%20beefing%20with%20a%20six-year-old%3f%20The%20feud%2c%20explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-is-tiktok-star-matt-rife-beefing-with-a-six-year-old-the-feud-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-tiktok-star-matt-rife-beefing-with-a-six-year-old-the-feud-explained.html&title=Why%20is%20TikTok%20star%20Matt%20Rife%20beefing%20with%20a%20six-year-old%3f%20The%20feud%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-is-tiktok-star-matt-rife-beefing-with-a-six-year-old-the-feud-explained.html&title=Why%20is%20TikTok%20star%20Matt%20Rife%20beefing%20with%20a%20six-year-old%3f%20The%20feud%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-is-tiktok-star-matt-rife-beefing-with-a-six-year-old-the-feud-explained.html&title=Why%20is%20TikTok%20star%20Matt%20Rife%20beefing%20with%20a%20six-year-old%3f%20The%20feud%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-is-tiktok-star-matt-rife-beefing-with-a-six-year-old-the-feud-explained.html&description=Why%20is%20TikTok%20star%20Matt%20Rife%20beefing%20with%20a%20six-year-old%3f%20The%20feud%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./r-kelly-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A look at R.
